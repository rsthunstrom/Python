Jupyter notebook with classification models for Spend Prediction


We will create our sales prediction using an ensemble of models for the probability of purchase, and the expected sales given a purchase:

Likely to Purchase | p(purchase)
* Expected Sales given Purchase | e(sales | purchase)
* Predicted Spend = p(purchase) * e(sales | purchase)
